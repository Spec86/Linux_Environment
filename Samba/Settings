$ whereis samba

$ mkdir -p /home/samba/
$ sudo -R -0777 /home/samba/

$ sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
Then press Ctrl-O to save and Ctrl-X to exit from the nano text editor.

Now that we have our new share configured, save it and restart Samba for it to take effect:
$ sudo service smbd restart

Update the firewall rules to allow Samba traffic:
$ sudo ufw allow samba

Since Samba doesnâ€™t use the system account password, we need to set up a Samba password for our user account:
$ sudo smbpasswd -a username
